A robust, thread-safe and async-friendly library for IRC clients in Rust. It's compliant with
[RFC 2812](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812), [IRCv3.1](http://ircv3.net/irc/3.1.html),
[IRCv3.2](http://ircv3.net/irc/3.2.html), and includes some additional, common features. It also
includes a number of useful built-in features to faciliate rapid development of clients. You can
find up-to-date, ready-to-use documentation online [here](https://docs.rs/irc/). The
documentation is generated with the default features. These are, however, strictly optional and
can be disabled accordingly.

## Getting Started ##

To start using this library with cargo, you can simply add `irc = "0.13"` to your dependencies in
your Cargo.toml file. You'll likely want to take a look at some of the examples, as well as the
documentation. You'll also be able to find below a small template to get a feel for the library.

## Getting Started by Example ##

```rust
extern crate irc;

use std::default::Default;
use irc::client::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let cfg = Config {
        nickname: Some(format!("irc-rs")),
        server: Some(format!("irc.example.com")),
        channels: Some(vec![format!("#test")]),
        .. Default::default()
    };
    let client = IrcClient::from_config(cfg).unwrap();
    client.identify().unwrap();
    client.for_each_incoming(|message| {
        // Do message processing.
    }).unwrap()
}
```

It may not seem like much, but all it takes to get started with an IRC connection is the stub
above. In just a few lines, you can be connected to a server and processing IRC messages as you
wish. The library is built with flexibility in mind. If you need to work on multiple threads,
simply clone the server and have at it. We'll take care of the rest.

You'll probably find that programmatic configuration is a bit of a chore, and you'll often want to
be able to change the configuration between runs of the program (for example, to change the server
that you're connecting to). Fortunately, runtime configuration loading is straightforward.

```rust
extern crate irc;

use irc::client::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let client = IrcClient::new("config.toml").unwrap();
    client.identify().unwrap();
    client.for_each_incoming(|message| {
        // Do message processing.
    }).unwrap()
}
```

## Configuration ##

Like the rest of the IRC crate, configuration is built with flexibility in mind. You can easily
create `Config` objects programmatically and choose your own methods for handling any saving or
loading of configuration required. However, for convenience, we've also included the option of
loading files with `serde` to write configurations. The default configuration format is TOML,
though there is optional support for JSON and YAML via the optional `json` and `yaml` features. All
the configuration fields are optional, and can thus be omitted, but a working configuration requires
at least a `server` and `nickname`. You can find detailed explanations of the configuration format
[here](https://docs.rs/irc/0.12.8/irc/client/data/config/struct.Config.html#fields).

Here's an example of a complete configuration in TOML:

```toml
owners = []
nickname = "user"
nick_password = "password"
alt_nicks = ["user_", "user__"]
username = "user"
realname = "Test User"
server = "chat.freenode.net"
port = 6697
password = ""
use_ssl = true
cert_path = "cert.der"
encoding = "UTF-8"
channels = ["#rust", "#haskell", "#fake"]
umodes = "+RB-x"
user_info = "I'm a test user for the Rust IRC crate."
version = "irc:git:Rust"
source = "https://github.com/aatxe/irc"
ping_time = 180
ping_timeout = 10
burst_window_length = 8
max_messages_in_burst = 15
should_ghost = false
ghost_sequence = []

[channel_keys]
"#fake" = "password"

[options]
note = "anything you want can be in here!"
and = "you can use it to build your own additional configuration options."
key = "value"
```

You can convert between different configuration formats with `convertconf` like so:

```
cargo run --example convertconf -- -i client_config.json -o client_config.toml
```

Note that the formats are automatically determined based on the selected file extensions. This 
tool should make it easy for users to migrate their old configurations to TOML.

## Contributing ##
Contributions to this library would be immensely appreciated. Prior to version 0.12.0, this
library was public domain. As of 0.12.0, this library is offered under the Mozilla Public License
2.0 whose text can be found in `LICENSE.md`. Fostering an inclusive community around `irc` is
important, and to that end, we've adopted an explicit Code of Conduct found in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
